    <span>We organise a retreat camp in the forests of The Castle-Crowsnest Watershed Natural Area (CCWNA) in southwest Alberta,
    Canada. The camp allows you to withdraw for two weeks from all the stresses of life in the city and enjoy an intimate
    connection with nature, meet new people and heal your inner self.</span>

        individuals can

        personal
        growth.
